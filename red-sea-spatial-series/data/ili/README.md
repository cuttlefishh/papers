The files in this directory are processed data formatted for use with the [`ili Toolbox](ili-toolbox.github.io). The 3D coordinates (columns X, Y, Z, and radii) are specific for this tool, but the other data columns can be used generally for other visualizations or purposes.

See our [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/055012) in The ISME Journal for more information about these samples.
